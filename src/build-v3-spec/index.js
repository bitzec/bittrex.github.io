This option allows you to instruct the system to sell enough of the base currency to increase your account balance of the quote currency by the specified amount. \n\nTo see all of the recent changes, please visit the [change list](https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200567324-Changelist)."

                "description": "### Overview\n Several Bittrex API resources support bulk fetches via 'list' API methods. For example, you can list deposits, list closed orders, and list withdrawals. These list API methods share a common structure, using at least these three parameters: `pageSize, nextPageToken and previousPageToken.` These parameters, if necessary are specified as query parameters on the HTTP request.\n\n ### Arguments:\n\n\n\n - __pageSize(optional)__: A limit on the number of objects to be returned between 1 and 200, defaults to 100\n - __nextPageToken(optional)__: It is a cursor for for using pagination and acts is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects ending with objFoo, your subsequent call can include `nextPageToken=objFoo` in order to fetch the next page of the list. Typically used for paginating in the forward direction.\n\n - __previousPageToken(optional)__: It is a cursor for for using pagination and acts is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects starting with objBar, your subsequent call can include `previousPageToken=objBar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list. Typically used for paginating in the reverse direction.\n\n\n ### Examples:\n\nList withdrawals, in reverse chronological order, up to maximum of 20 withdrawals, starting at the most recent withdrawal created:\n\n`https://api.bittrex.com/v3/withdrawals?pageSize=20`\n\nList withdrawals, in reverse chronological order, up to maximum of 10 withdrawals, starting after the withdrawal with ID of `940af3c3-665d-4432-a12e-cdf8fd99ab3b`\n\n`https://api.bittrex.com/v3/withdrawals?pageSize=10&nextPageToken=940af3c3-665d-4432-a12e-cdf8fd99ab3b`\n\n List withdrawals, in reverse chronological order, up to a maximum of 10 withdrawals, ending before the withdrawal with ID of `0d990dd2-4103-4d57-8e80-047e886537db`: \n\n`https://api.bittrex.com/v3/withdrawals?pageSize=10&previousPageToken=0d990dd2-4103-4d57-8e80-047e886537db`\n\n"

                "description": "### __Order Types__:\n\n - __Market Order__ :An order to buy or sell an asset immediately at the best available price. The price at which a market order will execute often deviates from the last-traded price or “real time” quote.\n\n - __Limit Order__ :An order to trade a specified quantity of an asset at a specified rate or better.A buy order will only be filled at or below the limit price and a sell order will only be filled at or above the limit price.\n\n - __Ceiling Order__ : It is a type of market order which executes orders to buy/sell a specified total value of the order at the best, currently available price (e.g. buy $100 USD of BTC at the current market BTC price)\n\n - __Good-Til-Cancelled Order__ : A Good-Til-Cancelled (GTC) order is an order to buy or sell a token that lasts until the order is completed, expired, or cancelled.The maximum lifetime of any order is 28 days. Any order older then 28 days will be automatically canceled by the system and all reserved funds will be returned to your account.\n\n - __Immediate-Or-Cancel Order__ : An Immediate-Or-Cancel (IOC) order is an order to buy or sell a token that must be executed immediately. Any portion of an IOC order that cannot be filled immediately will be cancelled.\n\n - __Fill-or-Kill__ : This option allows orders to be placed which will be filled immediately and completely, or not at all.\n\n - __Post Only__ : This option allows market makers to ensure that their orders are making it to the order book instead of matching with a pre-existing order. Note: If the order is not a maker order, you will return an error and the order will be cancelled \n\n\n ### __Order types and time in force__ : \n\n The following table shows which time in force options apply to which order types.\n\n\n<div style='overflow-x:auto;'><table><tbody><tr><th>timeInForce</th><th>LIMIT</th><th>MARKET</th><th>CEILING_LIMIT</th><th>CEILING_MARKET</th></tr><tr><td>GOOD_TIL_CANCELLED</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td></tr><tr><td>IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCEL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td></tr><tr><td>FILL_OR_KILL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td></tr><tr><td>POST_ONLY_GOOD_TIL_CANCELLED</td><td>BUY OR SELL</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td><td>NOT ALLOWED</td></tr></tbody></table></div> \n\n\n ### __clientOrderId__: \n\n It is an optional UUID which is generated by the user to to keep a track of the order. If the outcome of placing an order is not known (for example due to a client-side crash that occurred while placing the order), the same order can be safely placed again using the same UUID as the clientOrderId. If the order was received and processed the first time, the API will return an error that includes the existing order's id instead of creating a second order. This protection is in place for 24 hours after an order is placed. Although clientOrderIds which are more than 24 hours old are no longer checked against new orders, they remain associated with their orders as metadata and may be retrieved by clients.\n\n"
